Again, we are confronted with  "neutral technologies", like facial recognition and license plate tracking, that end up recreating systems of oppression and inequality. And the linked question: will we decide to actually regulate these technologies? ü§î

This is the way that privacy ends up eroding for us all, but it is unequal in who benefits and who suffers.

Let's all take a stand in saying that security via unbounded data collection is a Bad Idea, and that there are better (yes, more difficult!) ways to make our lives safer.

When privileged folks (like myself) partake in this type of security theater (ahem, Amazon Blink), we reinforce the idea that more data collection == more security. We also feed data into systems that disproportionately affect already targeted communities.

Facial recognition and surveillance systems are an obvious example. There are less obvious ones too - gait detection, AI to determine "anomalous" online behavior, ranking systems for "gangs" and "criminals". 

Often these systems target and affect the most vulnerable populations.

A lot of people tell me that more security also means more privacy (and vice versa), but this ignores the fact that the "security" community makes quite a lot of money violating privacy.

As pointed out in this thread, corporate surveillance leads to more government surveillance (and vice versa). When large tech companies are allowed to spy on us in exchange for services, it creates pressure for governments to do the same! Not a good future for anyone involved. https://t.co/CTogw2rMQ6

@blakedot_ @networkservice To learn more, I recommend reading the Netflix attack, the is census reconstruction attack and the research that started Cambridge analytica! :)

@blakedot_ @networkservice Unfortunately aggregation does not equal anonymization. Due to ways we can slice, combine and infer details from data, any data released in aggregate leaks private information.

If you have a data flow dataset that I can use, I could likely devise several reidentification attacks

@ThomGavinKaye If you're looking for obscurity, a cloud browser is not it. It would actually be a huge signal in data.

@sergedroz @woodyatpch I meant that website operators know your device, which is usually fairly unique. And your ISP can easily combine data with other sources (just using a VPN makes you more identifiable in data / machine learning)

I'm investigating some side ideas on how someone (or all of us) can use the internet more privately. It might end up being a project. If you want to stay tuned or know someone I should talk to, let me know! :)

And, unfortunately, netflow data (or how traffic traverses the internet) is now a new data source to sell. This is super dangerous, because it means there will be ways to see how we all use the internet as well as single out particular flows... :( https://t.co/ckjk5OOcxX

A lot of people believe VPNs help them obtain privacy, but that is generally a misconception. A few reasons why:

1. Your ISP still has your data
2. Your browser still has your data
3. Your device is still your device, even if it has a new "location/address".

Note: I do want to point out that this article / repo is still building a facial recognition system, which are often used directly to violate privacy and surveil persons without their consent. üòê

This is in opposition to data where we learn on real datasets, of real people, often collected without consent and then make "synthetic data" that often leaks private information! 

See: https://t.co/D7idLIN9EF for more.

This tidbit is great:

Since we sample parts of our model independently, we sometimes get unusual (but not impossible) combinations, such as feminine faces that have a beard.

We should create more ACTUALLY synthetic data that looks like worlds we DO and want to exist in. :)

So excited to see work like this, that generates fully synthetic data, not real data disguised as synthetic!

They built programmatic creation of faces, skin tones, hairstyles and clothing, producing realistic looking "people" who actually do not exist.

https://t.co/6QLCXr9Wzq

Better security will always derive from bottoms-up approaches, not top-down control. 

Building tools with privacy built in will always grant trust where it should, on the user level. 

Final note: stop spying on your employees. It's not going to work out the way you think.

One theory on Okta attack vector is that their own surveillance software opened a pathway for superuser access. 

Another win for privacy-first design to holistically offer better security than an Orwellian approach, where "security" comes via control tower surveillance. https://t.co/byAgDN4DqJ

Until the incentive system is changed, this will continue to happen. Until we demand that our governments do not surveil ANYONE, then this will continue to happen. So long as we say we have nothing to hide, other people will not have choices on hiding.

Just like with ClearviewAI (or Facebook, really), someone has an idea that is "innocuous" sounding. They get funding and build out a team or product. Someone asks them, well can this be used for [insert surveillance use case]? Boom. Pivot. Profit. Repeat.

You cannot make this stuff up. A company that was building software / hardware to track cattle is now working with ICE on immigrant surveillance. This pivot is not the first or last we'll see in surveillance tech, where unsafe ideas become profitable.

@ustoll Happy to chat! Feel free to DM me or reach out on LI to schedule! :)

@ustoll It's working for me on a local system I've been building, based on simple NLP models. Next step is exploratory algorithm integration. So far no problems for what I actually care about / want to read and the privacy and control I get from decentralized is my main priority.

@ustoll My definition of a powerful recommender is a hyper-local, personalized one (i.e. that I own and build and rebuild as I desire).

@ustoll Cool! Will there be an open-source release that can work without communicating to a central server?

if already have one - plz send link or description! :)

If you had an open-source tool to build your own private personalized content recommender, but you need to:

- curate a few content sources
- curate a few keywords
- use an interface to say whether a piece of content is interesting or not

would you use it?

@blakedot_ @PoolpOrg I'm very open to suggestions! Currently it's looking pretty grim in terms of options and integrations. Another goal is to not have to figure out how to host my own relay... but I'm guessing that's obvious üòÖ

@Ghost  - if someone wanted to use Ghost and a EU-based bulk mail service (not Mailgun, not SES) without syncing databases (for privacy and data sovereignty reasons), where could they get started? Is there a good place in the code / integration to look?

@technige @ProtonMail I think they don't offer SMTP relay as a service -- only to folks who have email accounts. That said, I could always just move my DNS email registry to them and use their service then as a relay. 

Do you use them with your own domain?

Ultimate goal would be:

- Data hosted in Europe
- Data minimization built in (i.e. I can hold the emails, the service just does the send)
- Reasonable prices for small amount of emails per month (&lt;$30/mo if possible)
- Clear privacy policy and data processing agreement

Ask: Does anyone know of a privacy-first SMTP Relay or Email Service Provider that has scaled pricing or reasonable costs for a small newsletter.

@tymwol This is neat, thanks!! but not what I meant. The one I used was focused on data viz for the data itself... I. E. How do we better visualize the biases (and variance and skew) in your data. I think they had some visualizations with clustering or other ways to show class imbalance

Please help me find a thing! About 4 years ago, Google announced a tool that could easily visualize tabular data and point out things like bias in class distribution, outliers and other potential "ethical risks". Do you remember this tool too? What was it called? Thank you!

Ich war heute in einem Interview und hab mich zuf√§llig entscheiden auf Deutsch zu pr√§sentieren. Dann kam mein Flowchart in der Pr√§sentation. 

"Und hier habe ich ein... erm.... Denkpfad gebaut..."

Warum ist es immer die einfachen Worte?? üòÇ

If you or anyone you know is working on either a) or b) (or is at a platform that is actively making progress), I'd love to read more and hear what is the latest. However, I do think until we change product incentives, we will end up playing whack-a-mole for quite a bit longer..

One note I had to myself from now 3 or so years ago is: a) how misinfo/disinfo can become as commonplace w/in security as fighting spam and b) how we can denormalize the dark patterns that help make it spread (i.e. engagement KPIs!). (6/x)

No one is unsusceptible, because the types of things that help it spread are wonderful things about humans. Our ability to see connections, reinforce our own analysis and trust the people around us. I don't want us to lose these qualities either! (5/x)

Because we no longer have local news and basic trust in institutions is at an all-time low, disinfo moves beyond the fringes and into mainstream and becomes "normalized". US-exported rugged individualism makes every person fight for their own "truth". (4/x)

When we combine well-known frames with "engagement-driven" products, we create fertile ground for information disorders. Short-term OKRs permeate our internal decisions and create short-term goals and shortcuts that reinforce dark patterns in our designs/algos/products. (3/x)

This is not just due to the current political "crisis" in Poland, but also because this type of information warfare and the spread of information disorders has become so commonplace and "normal" that I can find links to these techniques on a daily basis. (2/x)

I'm reading through notes I made more than two years ago on disinformation campaigns in Poland and it pains me to say it feels like these notes could have been made yesterday. (1/x)

@bookingcom I share this so that if you have a booking account, you know that likely the password database has been breached. And the security is broken. My advice: delete your account. üëçüèª

@jeremyjkun Thank you, this is super helpful input ü§ó

@jeremyjkun Is it ever practical (from your perspective) to look at research and other trends to help guide thinking on unsolved problems? As in, there are a few clear "there aren't industry wide best practices, so here's some ways to think about the problem from research"...

2. Where is the line between practical advice and teaching someone how to think about the problem in new ways? If you picked up a book that was called practical, what would you expect?

Two questions that I've been pondering that I need feedback on:

1. Have we reached a point in tech culture where folks in technology realize that the "soft" parts of the problem are also the "hard" parts? Example: creating a culture of privacy is just as hard as implementing DP
