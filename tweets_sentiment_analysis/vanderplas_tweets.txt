@pganssle One example: in JAX's core primitives, by convention positional arguments are traced &amp; keyword arguments are static. JAX makes heavy use of decorator-based function transformations, which can be implemented more generically by enforcing static arguments to be keyword-only.

@davis_yoshida Oh, that's really nice! I didn't think about the possibility of dropping terms...

@__mharrison__ Yeah, I used that formula for the linear search. What I'm talking about is a closed-form solution to $0 = d/dy \sum_{i=1}^N |y - x_i|(|y - x_i| + 1)/2$, to avoid the linear search.

After solving it by linear search, I tried and failed today to find a closed-form solution for Advent of Code day 7. Part 1 is L1 loss, minimized by the median... Part 2 simplifies to basically a sum of L1 &amp; L2 loss and I'm not sure whether a closed-form minimum exists...

@michaelaye But it sounds like maybe you're not concerned with rendering so much as data, and to that point it's true that Altair (and the vega ecosystem as a whole) is designed primarily around tabular data, not, say, multi-dimensional image data.

@michaelaye All rendering lives outside of Altair. Altair is just a Python API for Vega, which you can read about at https://t.co/bmJE3GdhAO

I believe the canvas renderer has been the default for some time now?

@michaelaye Altair has had raster rendering available for several years via the canvas renderer.

Re panel/holoviz: it's a phenomenal ecosystem, and you should keep using it if it works for you.

I sometimes accidentally type Python code into a shell prompt... like "import numpy as numpy" (-&gt; bash: import: command not found)

@dstndstn @exoplaneteer @astropy I once thought about writing an April 1st paper called "the tools used to write this paper" that would basically just be a paragraph with a figure plus pages of software citations...

@exoplaneteer @astropy I think my favorite example of this is the discrepancy in citations between the main scikit-learn paper (~47,000) and the main numpy paper from the same year (~8000).

 It is impossible to use scikit-learn without also using numpy. And yet...
